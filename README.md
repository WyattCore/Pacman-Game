# Pacman-Game
Demonstrates proficiency in object oriented programming, inheritance, model-view-controller program architecture, and an ai coded ghost. I used a system of nodes and seekers to connect all of the nodes into a graph of the map. This allowed for pacman to move between the lines of the nodes instead of freely. This started as a class project but I decided to make my own by adding game like functionality, movement restrictions, ghost ai that chases Pacman around the screen and runs when Pacman eats a pellet. Spawns a ghost and a pellet every 5 seconds, survive as long as you can!

HOW TO RUN

Just download the zip file for all of the code and extract it to a separate file. Start up the terminal at the src file from the extracted folder and run "python3 game.py"
The controls are simple: 
 Use the arrows to move pacman around the screen to collect pellets and eat ghosts!!
